# Hi, I'm Austin 👋

I'm a Technical Product Manager who builds healthcare platforms.

I shipped the Hedfirst telehealth platform in 12 months: 514 medications, 20+ disease states, 48-state pharmacy fulfillment, and HIPAA-compliant AI clinical workflows. Real patients, real prescriptions, real revenue.

Most product managers write PRDs and hand them off. I code enough to challenge engineering estimates, design database schemas, and debug API integrations when things break. I've built prescription routing systems, lab test integrations, and pharmacy fulfillment workflows that process hundreds of orders monthly.

**What I Build**

- 🏥 **Healthcare platforms**: Multi-tenant telehealth SaaS, e-prescribing, pharmacy networks
- 🤖 **AI clinical workflows**: Claude API integration for medical documentation, diagnostic support
- 💊 **Prescription systems**: DoseSpot/SureScripts integration, pharmacy fulfillment automation
- 🔬 **Lab integrations**: Choose Health at-home testing, results processing, provider workflows
- 💳 **Healthcare billing**: Subscription architecture, membership models, payment processing
- 🔒 **Compliance**: HIPAA, SOC 2, LegitScript certification, BAA management
- 📊 **Product frameworks**: North Star metrics, RICE scoring, OKR implementation
